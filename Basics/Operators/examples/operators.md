### Operators

Operators in Python are special symbols or keywords that are used to perform operations on variables and values. Python supports a wide range of operators, categorized into several types. These operators allow you to perform tasks such as arithmetic calculations, assign values to variables, compare values, perform logical operations, and more.

Here are the main types of operators in Python:

Arithmetic Operators: Used for performing basic mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and more.

Assignment Operators: Used to assign values to variables. They include the equal sign (=) and various compound assignment operators.

Relational Operators: Used to compare values and determine the relationship between them. They return a Boolean result (True or False).

Logical Operators: Used to combine and manipulate Boolean values. They include "and," "or," and "not."

Identity Operators: Used to check if two variables point to the same object in memory. The identity operators in Python are "is" and "is not."

Membership Operators: Used to check if a value is present in a sequence or collection, such as a list, tuple, or string. The membership operators in Python are "in" and "not in."

Bitwise Operators: Used to perform operations on individual bits of binary numbers. They include bitwise AND, OR, XOR, and more.

Precedence of Operations: Operators in Python have different levels of precedence, which determine the order in which operations are performed in an expression.
