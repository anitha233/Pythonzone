### Relational(Comparison) Operator

* Used to compare two values and relationship between them. These operators return a Boolean result, which is either `True` or `False`.

## List of operators
```python
     Operator   Description           Example
      ==        Equal to            3 == 2 → False
      !=        Not equal to        3 != 2 → True
      >         Greater than        3 > 2 → True
      <         Less than           3 < 2 → False
     >=        Greater than or equal to  3 >= 2 → True
     <=        Less than or equal to  3 <= 2 → False
```

## Example

## Equal to
```python
x = 5
y = 5
result = x == y # result will be True
```

## Not equal to
```python
x = 5
y = 3
result = x != y  # result will be True
```
